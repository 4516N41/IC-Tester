**Improvements and additional features**
      
• No need to reboot the device after each test.
      
• Interactive layout of ICs which lets the user check the functionality of ICs manually without additional circuitry.
      
• Truthtable/Timing diagram generation, manually and automaticaly generated. Saves the truthtables as a CSV file.
      
• Loop testing, the program keeps track of passed/failed tests and which pins are the most like to be the culprits.
      
• Shortcut for Last test routine so the user can quickly set up a test for a sum of the same IC types.
      
• Configuration where the user can tailor the behaviour of the program to suit their testing needs.
      
• Added tests and pinouts for 20 & 24 Pin ICs.
