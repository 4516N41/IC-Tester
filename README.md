**Improvements and additional features**
      
• No need to reboot the device after each test.
      
• Interactive graphical layout of ICs which lets the user check the functionality of ICs manually without additional circuitry.
      
• Truthtable/Timing diagram generation, both manually and automaticaly generated. Saves the truthtables as a CSV file.
      
• Loop testing available, the program keeps track of both passed and failed tests as well as which pins are the most like to be the culprits.
      
• Shortcut for Last test routine so the user can quickly set up a test for a sum of the same IC types.
      
• Configuration where the user can tailor the behaviour of the program to suit their testing needs.
      
• Added tests and pinouts for 20 & 24 Pin ICs.
