# KickSort
Arduino library for different sorting algorithms including quicksort, bubble sort, insertion sort, shell sort, and comb sort.  

This library is built from aggregating and modifying different sorting implementations from various other GitHub users including: robtillaart, emilv, luisllamasbinaburo, and dndubins. Thanks!
