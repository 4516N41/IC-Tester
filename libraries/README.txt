TFT Libraries

Sadly there are plenty of different screens and controllers being sold as the same thing.

I have only acquired and tested the SPFD5408 variants and even they don't work exactly the same... :[

1# If your screen only shows white after you have uploaded the sketch you probably need the other one. as in the adafruit type instead of the SPFD one or vice versa

2# If you have graphics on your screen after uploading but touch doesn't work and/or is inverted then you need to read the manual which goes into more depth on the subject.
